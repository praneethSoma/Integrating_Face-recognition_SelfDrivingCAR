The proposed solution is a unified system that combines face recognition technology with an autonomous self-driving automobile system to improve safety, efficiency, and usefulness.The solution consists of three stages: constructing and refining a self-driving model for use in a simulated environment, implementing user detection and authentication using face recognition technology, and showcasing the integrated system's efficiency and practicality using the CARLA simulator.It is designed to stimulate driving scenarios where the vehicle’s ignition system is coupled with face recognition.Additionally, a Location and Alert System is suggested to strengthen the system's defences and enhance the reliability of self-driving cars. The system will alert the user for face recognition at frequent periods of time.If it doesn’t  match , it will alert the user.
